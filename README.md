## Description

“AI Companion” is an emotional companion for high-agency women in singlehood who feel burned out by dating and stuck in self-discovery. It provides a private “Gentle Listener” that remembers her, validates her feelings, and offers tools to explore desires, boundaries, and sexual wellness safely.

## Features

- Real-time text chat with an “AI companion” persona tuned as a “Gentle Listener” by default
- Store and reuse key facts (work, friends, ex, patterns, preferences) to personalize follow‑ups
- Detect sentiment (e.g., low mood, stress, playful) per message and adjust pacing and depth accordingly
- Guided check‑ins and reflections about dates, boundaries, and patterns

## Technologies

Built with TypeScript, CSS, and HTML.
